# This project is now dead due to Snap Inc letting Gfycat die without warning.
I'm currently evaluating another alternatives to Gfycat, but it will take some time.

## :space_invader: Technologies

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  * Javascript superset that makes it actually safe (and kinda fun üòÅ) to use.
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
  * Next is the Javascript/React framework that I chose for this project, since it's currently the one that interests me the most and fits my needs.
* [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  * I used tRPC instead of something like Express or GraphQL, mainly because I really like the [t3 stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app).
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
  * I chose to use a Component Library like Chakra UI because it allowed me to be more focused on my code, instead of styling. It increased my development time, and it's the one that I find more easy to customize if I need to.
  * Chakra needs [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to work 
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [MySQL with Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/)
  * I really wanted to try something differente than MongoDB or Firebase, basically I wanted to give relational databases a try. Also, giving the nature of my project (having users, letting users upload stuff, etc), a document-based approach in my database would've been a nightmare to work with.
* [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
  * Authentication has never been easier than with Next-auth.

## Starting the project.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

### Prerequirements

This project uses either yarn or npm as dependency/package manager. You should have npm installed if you already have Node. If you choose to use yarn, run the next command to install it:

```bash
 npm i -g yarn
```

<!-- Run Locally -->

### :running: Running the project locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:enzom-uy/mylo.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd mylo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
# with yarn:
  yarn
# with npm:
  npm install

You'll need to declare some env variables if you actually want it to work.
